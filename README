(demo coming soon!)

I really love the creative possibilities that loopers offer.  Apparently a
lot of other people do too, because there are a ton of great open-source 
loopers.  However, all of them are sample-based, and I've encountered a 
number of situations in the past where this has held me back from getting
the sounds that I wanted.

This looper is for MIDI data instead of samples, and aims to solve some of
the problems inherent in using sampling loopers.  When I set out to create
it, my primary use case was in looping pad synths with long sustains.  By
looping the MIDI data and feeding it into my synthesis engine of choice as
if it were a continuous stream of normal MIDI data, I can get loops with
smooth boundaries that would be difficult if not impossible to achieve with
sampling loopers.

This method of looping obviously also requires a significantly smaller memory
footprint for its buffers, so in computing environments where processing time
is relatively abundant in comparison to memory, it may enable looping where it
would otherwise be impossible.

Hey, YOU!  If you're still reading this, there's a good chance you're at least
moderately interested in using this thing.  Let me know! (jtotto@uwaterloo.ca)
There are a whole pile of additional features needed to actually make this thing
useful (probably the most significant of which is tempo quantization).  If you
exist, I would be happy to jump right on it.
